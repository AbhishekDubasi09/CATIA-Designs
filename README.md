# CATIA-Designs
A growing collection of complex, industry-grade mechanical components â€” modeled with precision in CATIA. From engine housings to structural casings, every design reflects the raw geometry of real-world machines. Built to showcase manufacturing-aware modelling, geometric constraints, and part-assembly thinking.
