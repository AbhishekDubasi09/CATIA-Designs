# CATIA V5 Design Models

This repository showcases a collection of mechanical part and assembly designs created using CATIA V5. Each model emphasizes industrial design standards, dimensional accuracy, and manufacturability.

## Included Designs

- Parametric part models (Sketch-Based and Boolean-Based)
- Complex assemblies with constraint systems
- Drafting sheets with technical dimensions

## Highlights

- Fully constrained 3D parts and assemblies
- Focus on design intent and feature-based modeling
- Ready for conversion to manufacturing drawings
